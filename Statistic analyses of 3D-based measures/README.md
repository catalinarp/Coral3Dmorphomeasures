# <b> Statistic analyses of 3D-based measures </b>

This folder contains the files and scripts used to perform statistic analyses to evaluate the performance of individual candidate taxonomic features using univariate analyses, to perform feature selection for a prospective combination of representative characters that support interspecific differentiation and finally to assess the discriminative power of the selected combination of features through multivariate analysis.

<b>Summary table | Outline of the quantitative morphological variables assessed from the 3D data according to their type: branch, complexity and curvature </b><br>
Units, abbreviations (Abbr.) and outputs obtained for each feature are also displayed. Global values (G) were obtained from the complete specimens, density distributions (D) were estimated per branch in the skeleton or per vertex of the polygon mesh when possible. Finally, univariate average measures (A) were calculated including mean values (_mean), and variance (_var) for both curvature and branch-derived variables, and also skewness (_skew) and kurtosis (_kurt) for curvature variables.
