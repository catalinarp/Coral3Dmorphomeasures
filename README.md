After 3D models were rendered and processed, meshes were then exported as triangulated mesh files (either .stl or .obj) for downstream analyses derived either from triangulated polygon meshes, medial axis skeleton graphs or a combination of both.

To provide a quantitative assessment of the estimated morphological variables, both univariate values and distributions were analysed using R v4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2018) through the Rstudio console v1.4.1103 (RStudio Team, 2017). The three species previously delineated in this data set (Ramírez-Portilla et al., 2021), were used as a three-level factor for all the subsequent analyses.

<b> Schematic representation | 3D model rendering and skeletonization from a coral specimen </b><br> 
Morphology of irregularly shaped organisms (from both living tissue and skeleton specimens) can be analysed using 3D scanning. Downstream processing renders three-dimensional models as either a triangulated polygon mesh or a medial axis skeleton from which variables such as curvature, branch length, width, spacing, and angle can be estimated.
